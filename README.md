# AWS SageMaker Deployment Project

In this project we are mainly learning how to use sagemaker, we built a single-layer recurrent neural network, using pytorch, for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. The deployment of the model is done using Amazon's SageMaker platform. In addition, we will be deploying the model and construct a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model. 

Unfortunately, API Endpoints are bit too pricey for me to keep the site up, so below you can see pictures of the site with two reviews :)

**Make sure to shutdown endpoints, they are paid for per hour!
